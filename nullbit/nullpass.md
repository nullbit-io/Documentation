Login is achieved by verifying a signature against a wallet address. If the signature is valid, the system uses the users wallet address as the login credential.

### Lightning Node

Login is achieved by extracting the public key from a signature. If the node that signed the message is visible, the system uses the nodes public key as the login credential.
